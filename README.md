OS-X-Configuration
==================

Configuration and set up files for my mac environment.

This will house my set up files to get from a bare-bones OS X installation to as close to my default configuration as possible. I'm currently using YADR (on github) and then adding these programs. I will either fork YADR or develop my own dotfiles in the future.

My thought is that I want my environment to be as close to my standard as possible. The settings do not take me nearly as long to configure as actually getting all my commands (especially command line based programs).

Here is the order that I emphasize my overall configuration.

I emphasize programs over configuration. Configuration over themes. Themes and looks over small tweaks.

##Script

So here is what is included in my script so far.
